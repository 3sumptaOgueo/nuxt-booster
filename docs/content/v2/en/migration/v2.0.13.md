With the change to version `2.0.13` there are the following changes:


## Hardware performance check removed

The hardware check for showing the `SpeedkitLayer` has been removed.

The `device` option and the use of the message (`#nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device`) in the SpeedkitLayer, are no longer valid and must be removed. 

Alternatively, it now waits for a free `idle` slot when initializing the JS,

- if a free slot is available, the JS is initialized
- if no free slot is available, the message `#nuxt-speedkit-message-bad-performance` is showed in the SpeedkitLayer.

The old message `#nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device` must be replaced by the new `#nuxt-speedkit-message-bad-performance`.

```html
<li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device">
  outdated device
</li>
```

replaced with 

```html
<li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-bad-performance">
  bad performance
</li>
```
